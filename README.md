Matlab (www.mathworks.com) and Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) are required for most. Additional requirements are listed in the comments for each script and some of these are included in the Resources folder.

DTI_nets/:	        Scripts for preprocessing and preparing DTI data for connectome analyses 

minD.m:             Threshold matrices to minimum connection density (data driven)

INC.m:              Extract individual network contribution from group level connectivity matrices

TargetedAttack.m    Conduct targeted attack on nodes

rEdge.m             Conduct a random attack analysis on edges

powerL.R            Determines fit of degree distribution with power law and compares fit between groups

CPM.R:              R version of Finn et al.'s Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling Matlab scripts

CPM50.R             Same as CPM but with split-half cross validation (50 iterations)

GATcmd/:			Graph Analysis Toolbox command line version
