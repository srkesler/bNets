Matlab (www.mathworks.com) or GNU Octave (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) are required for most. Additional requirements are listed in the comments for each script and some of these are included in the Resources folder.

DTI_nets/:	  Scripts for preprocessing and preparing DTI data for connectome analyses 

CPM_R/:       R versions of Finn et al.'s Connectome Predictive Modeling Matlab scripts

GMefficiency/:  Calculate nodal efficiencies from individual gray matter networks (uses Tijms' similarity based extraction method)

GATcmd/:			Graph Analysis Toolbox command line version (coming soon!)
